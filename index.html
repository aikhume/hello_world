    <h1>More on my commit</h1>
    <p>When I type "git help commit", I'm shown the manual page for the "commit" command. As I scroll down, you'll see there are a ton of options that can be passed when you do a commit. I'll just be demonstrating the "-m" and "-a" options, because they are arguably the most commonly used options. I use them just about every time I use Git... copied.</p>

 <h2>When I Started My Commit</h2>
 <p>he above works as long as you can name the commit that should be the parent of your new commit. If you actually want your new file to be added via a new root commit (no parents), then you need something a bit different... copied.</p>
